# MicroCanvas

Microcontroller-friendly HTML5 Canvas library for easy games creation. You can
use the Clouduboy Compiler to emit arduino-ready C/C++ code from your JavaScript
game sources and run it on commercially available devices, or even one you built
yourself!

Refer to [`examples`](./examples/) to see some of the demos.

## About
The library uses familiar concepts well known for HTML5 (game-) developers,
the API tracks closely and simply expands on the [HTML5 Canvas API](
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

Other portions borrow from other specifications (e.g. the Web Animation API),
but the library stays close to concepts that web developers might already be
familiar with. This kind of "not-reinventing-the-wheel" serves two purposes,
one being the above mentioned improved learning curve, but also the fact that
any beginners who start off learning JavaScript & web development with
MicroCanvas learn valuable and useful lessons, tools, concepts and abstractions
that are readily available in other areas of web development.
